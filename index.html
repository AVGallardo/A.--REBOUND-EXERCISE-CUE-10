                Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried chicken, 
                but you happen to pull this shit while I'm in a transitional period so 
                I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help you. But I can't give you this case, 
                it don't belong to me. Besides, I've already been through too much shit
                this morning over this case to hand it over to your dumb ass

                Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic 
                tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it? Do you see a little Asian 
                child with a blank expression on his face sitting outside on a mechanical 
                helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's what you see at a toy store. 
                And you must think you're in a toy store, because you're here shopping for an infant named Jeb
